# # Google Cloud
#
# Gcloud is the official library for interacting with the Google Cloud Platform.
# Google Cloud Platform is a set of modular cloud-based services that allow
# you to create anything from simple websites to complex applications.
#
# Gcloud's goal is to provide a API that is familiar and comfortable to
# Rubyists. Authentication is handled by providing project and credential
# information, or if you are running on Google Compute Engine this configuration
# is taken care of for you.
#
# You can learn more about various options for connection on the [Authentication
# Guide](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/gcloud-ruby/#/docs/guides/authentication).
#
module Gcloud
  ##
  # Creates a new object for connecting to Google Cloud.
  #
  # For more information on connecting to Google Cloud see the [Authentication
  # Guide](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/gcloud-ruby/#/docs/guides/authentication).
  #
  # @param [String] project Project identifier for the Pub/Sub service you are
  #   connecting to.
  # @param [String, Hash] keyfile Keyfile downloaded from Google Cloud. If file
  #   path the file must be readable.
  #
  # @return [Gcloud]
  #
  # @example
  #   require "gcloud"
  #
  #   gcloud  = Gcloud.new
  #   datastore = gcloud.datastore
  #   pubsub  = gcloud.pubsub
  #   storage = gcloud.storage
  #
  def self.new project = nil, keyfile = nil
    gcloud = Object.new
    gcloud.instance_eval do
      @project = project
      @keyfile = keyfile
    end
    gcloud.extend Gcloud
    gcloud

  # Creates a new object for connecting to the Datastore service.
  # Each call creates a new connection.
  #
  # For more information on connecting to Google Cloud see the [Authentication
  # Guide](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/gcloud-ruby/#/docs/guides/authentication).
  #
  # @param [String, Array<String>] scope The OAuth 2.0 scopes controlling the
  #   set of resources and operations that the connection can access. See [Using
  #   OAuth 2.0 to Access Google
  #   APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2).
  #
  #   The default scopes are:
  #
  #   * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/datastore`
  #   * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email`
  #
  # @return [Gcloud::Datastore::Dataset]
  #
  # @example
  #   require "gcloud"
  #
  #   gcloud  = Gcloud.new
  #   datastore = gcloud.datastore
  #
  #   task = datastore.entity "Task" do |task|
  #     task["type"] = "Personal"
  #     task["done"] = false
  #     task["priority"] = 4
  #     task["description"] = "Learn Cloud Datastore"
  #   end
  #
  #   datastore.save task
  #
  # @example You shouldn't need to override the default scope, but you can:
  #   require "gcloud"
  #
  #   gcloud  = Gcloud.new
  #   platform_scope = "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform"
  #   datastore = gcloud.datastore scope: platform_scope

  #   bucket = storage.bucket "my-bucket"
  #   file = bucket.file "path/to/my-file.ext"
  #
  # @example The default scope can be overridden with the `scope` option:
  #   require "gcloud"
  #
  #   gcloud  = Gcloud.new
  #   readonly_scope = "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only"
